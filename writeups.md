## 01 Unstoppable

To beat this level, we need to comply with

```solidity

```
### Solution

Notice the following guard:

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = totalAssets();
if (convertToShares(totalSupply) != balanceBefore) revert InvalidBalance(); // enforce ERC4626 requirement
```

`convertToShares` will take the given **assets** (underlying token) and compute the amount of **shares**.

As it can be seen that `balanceBefore` is a measure of the **assets** in the vault, then there is a problem of units we can leverage.

Since `(convertToShares(totalSupply)` is `total shares * (total shares / total assets)`, and this quantity has to be equal to `total assets` (`balanceBefore`), it follows that if we manage to make the total of shares different to the total of assets, we would make the guard fail, preventing flash loans to work.

How do we pertub this ratio? We cannot mint or burn shares without `deposit` or `withdraw`. What we can do instead is incrementing the amount of the underlying asset (`DVT`) in the vault, with a simple `transfer()`.

```solidity
token.transfer(address(level.vault()), 1);
```

By transfering a single `DVT` token, the values checked at the guard will be different, breaking the flash loan.
